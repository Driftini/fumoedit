# Fumoedit
A simple Python module I plan to use as the backbone for [a proper editor](https://github.com/Driftini/fumoedit-qt) for [my website](https://driftini.github.io)'s posts.

This branch stops at support for V2 posts.

## Post version glossary
* **V1**: introduced with FumoNet.
* **V2**: revision of V1 introduced with Smoothie's 2022 update.
    * Transition to YAML's simpler syntax (different indentation, no brackets).
    * Picture variants are moved from pictures' `lowres` and `maxres` properties to an array.
